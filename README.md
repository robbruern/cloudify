# cloudify

This is our project for CS411 Database Design. 

Our project is a web app that you can log into using Spotify. The web app will interface with Spotify open api. The main goal of our project will be to introduce users to new songs that they have not heard before. We plan to introduce users to new songs by comparing them to friends and finding how similar they are to their friends followed by generating playlists from songs that their friends listen to that the user hasn't heard. You can also use our generation via Neo4j to recommend podcasts as well
