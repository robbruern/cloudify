# cloudify

This is our project for CS411 Database Design. 

Our project is a web app that you can log into using spotify. The web app will interface with both the soundcloud and spotify open apis. The web app will build the user a recommended playlist off of soundcloud exclusive songs and create that same playlist locally on for their use through spotify. Thus allowing the user to expand their music horizons.
